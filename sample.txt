- move to a more senior software developer position

- get started with Machine Learning, Data Science, Django or other hot areas that Python specialises in

- or just learn Python to be able to create your own Python apps quickly.

…then you need a solid foundation in Python programming. And this course is designed to give you those core skills, fast.

This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never programmed before, as well as existing programmers who want to increase their career options by learning Python.

The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical applications like Google Search.

And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. To get those high paying jobs you need an expert knowledge of Python, and that’s what you will get from this course.

By the end of the course you’ll be able to apply in confidence for Python programming jobs. And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.

Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.

“I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria

“I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get "stitched" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin

“This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen

And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.

Will this course give you core python skills?

Yes it will.  There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.

Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?

No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.  And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.

Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.

This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.

By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above.

Why should you take this course?

There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.  That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.

You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.

As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand. 

And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.

This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.

Here’s just some of what you’ll learn

(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)

·       All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating

·       You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.

·       Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.

·       Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.

·        How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  IntelliJ has both a FREE and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.  PyCharm will also work just fine.

(Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).

Does the course get updated?

It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released every day, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.

A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.

For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.

We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.

What if you have questions?

As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, or not at all).

This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks.

That’s just one reason why Tim was voted top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.  

Student Quote: “Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger

There’s no risk either!

This course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.

You either end up with Python skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it…

You literally can’t lose.

Instructors
Tim Buchalka
Java Python Android and C# Expert Developer - 1.33M students
Tim's been a professional software developer for close to 40 years.  During his career, he has worked for major companies such as Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, and Saab.

His video courses are used to train developers in major companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Paypal, VW, Pitney Bowes, IBM, and T-Mobile just to name a few (via the Udemy for Business program).

What makes Tim unique is his professional programming career - many instructors have never programmed professionally, let alone had a distinguished professional development career like Tim.

Tim has trained over 1.33 million students how to program, way more than a typical IT Professor at a college does in a lifetime.

In fact, Tim's courses are often purchased by students struggling to get through college programming courses.

"I am learning a lot about Java very quickly. I wish my college courses worked this way, they drag the same amount of material out over months." - Thomas Neal

"I love this guy. I'm in school for java right now at a local college and I bought this course hoping it would help clarify the fuzzy areas of my coursework. There's no comparison. Every time I get lost in my textbook, I watch a couple more of these videos and I'm right back on track. He explains everything so perfectly. It sinks right in." - Kristen Andreani

"Tim is a great instructor, I have more courses from him and all are great. This one really helped me with my understanding of Java from the very beginnings. In fact, I was able to find a job as Java developer with the knowledge gained from this course, so I basically owe Mr. Buchalka my career" - Daniel KubÃ¡nyi

Tim's mission is simple:  to make a difference in your life by helping you to become a software developer.  Tim does that through his Java, Python, C#, Spring Framework, and Android development courses.

When Tim started programming over thirty-five years ago, there was no online video training.  

There was no "easy" way to learn.  The Internet, in its current form, didn't exist, and as a result, Tim couldn't "Google" for help, or watch videos on Youtube.

After learning the hard way, Tim was determined to become the best teacher he could, and to make his training as painless as possible, so that you, or anyone else with the desire to become a software developer, could become one.

In between doing that, Tim spent the best part of those years as a professional software developer writing applications in Java and a variety of other languages.  In addition, he spent many years with J2EE (as it was then known), now known as Java Enterprise Edition (JEE), designing and developing enterprise applications.

Tim is relatively unique, in that he is a professional, experienced software developer who also has exceptional teaching skills.  

Many instructors have no work experience in the field.  Make sure the person you trust with your education is a real expert with substantial previous professional experience.

The bottom line for you is, when taking any of Tim's courses, is that you will learn the right way to do things from an expert, in the shortest possible amount of time.

Tim's Java, Android, and Python courses, here on Udemy are of the highest quality as reviewed by his students.   Ten's of thousands of students, just like you, have taken his classes, thousands have left glowing reviews, and many have gone on to full-time jobs, or consulting/freelancing opportunities after completing one of his courses.

Tim recently placed in the top ten Udemy instructors as voted for by his students and Udemy themselves.  

What does all of this mean for you?

You can have full confidence that Tim's courses are of exceptional quality, and that he can teach you to become a software developer if you have the desire to become one.

Are you ready to start?  You can get started today.  No previous experience is necessary.

In 2021, video training is the quickest way to learn, and with Tim's experience and training, it is possible for you to become a software developer.  You can do this.

Jean-Paul Roberts
Computer programmer, analyst and teacher
I am a programmer with over 30 years' experience gained in a range of industries, the last 16 with IBM.

I am now self employed developing apps for Android; programming in a range of languages including Java, Javascript and Python; and helping the next generation of programmers gain the skills that I have acquired over the years.

The first program I sold controlled stock movement in a warehouse, and ran on a CP/M computer - both the program and operating system lived in the 64 kb (yes, kilobytes) that was all CP/M systems had in those days.

I have gained experience in a wide range of industries including Utilities, Retail, Insurance and the Motor Manufacturing industry. My clients and employers have included Northumbrian Water, Arcadia, Royal Sun Alliance, Nissan and Jaguar Landrover. I also worked for Sunderland University for 3 years preparing and delivering training courses in computing.

Times have changed, the challenges are very different to what they were, but programming remains fun!

When not at my computer, I am often riding my motorbike through the wonderful countryside of the UK and Europe.

Tim Buchalka really does a good job being very thorough & not boring at the same time. Plus, you get to learn the australian accent 😄. For me the best were 2 sections & 1 recurring topic: oop, quering dbs (additional benefit for those who don't know sql: you'll learn the basics here) & tkinter gui. And if you think how much skill and knowledge you're getting for the $ you pay - it's a no-brainer. Again: 52 hours of a top-notch video content with loads of excercises and code snippets.
