Hi Martin,

I have completed the QA effort estimation for the below stories:

- H51771
- X51772

I would also like to inform you that I will be on PTO starting tomorrow and will resume work on 2nd January 2026.

Additionally, RT is scheduled to begin on 7th January. At that time, I will already have current sprint stories assigned to my board, along with stories from the Twilio board. Due to this workload, I will not be able to work on ST and RT in parallel.

If we receive the POC or detailed story information in advance, I can utilize some time during my PTO to validate them. Otherwise, we may need to consider removing these items from the January release.

Please let me know your thoughts or suggestions on how you would like to proceed.

Thanks and regards,
Pardeep Kumar
